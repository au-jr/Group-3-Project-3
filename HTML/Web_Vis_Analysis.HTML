     <h2> Data Findings </h2>
     <p> From the data visualisations, the development of countries is spotlighted by the Average income per Capita.
      <br>
      A key trends is visible between a Countries GDP and there Tonnes of Emmissions highlighted by developing and Under-developed countries.
      <br>
      For Developing countries whilst the Emissions increased for India, Brazil, South Africa and Egypt along with their GDP, Greece's Emissions decreased as their GDP did.
      For Developed countries the trend is found until 2010, after this date the impacts of renewable energy and carbon taxes are evident in the minimal decreased in emissions
      despite GDP growing.
      <br>
      <br>
      By dividing the Total Tonnes of Emissions by Population of Countries, we are able to also calculate the <a href="#Tonnes of Emissions Per Capita"> Tonnes of Emissions Per Capita
      </a>. This very clearly shows that developed 
      Countries are producing more Emissions per Capita then Developing and far more then Under-developed countries as outlined within the visualisation below.
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally from the starting data we are able to calculate the <a href="Tonnes of Emissions Per GDP $"> Tonnes of Emissions Per GDP $
      </a> by dividing Total Emissions by Total GDP.
      This figure represents how cost financially effective each tonne of Emissions produced is by each country.
      <br>
      The Tonnes of Emissions per $ of GDP, shows a clear trend of Under-developed and Developed countries equally producing very large quantities of Emissions per Tonne per $ of GDP compare 
      to Developed Countries.
      <br>
      <br>
      The extent of this is highlighted by the largest 5 Emissions per $ totalling 4787.22 compare to the lowest 5 Emissions per $ totalling only 1025.62. This calculates to 4.7 times more Emissions per $ of GDP.
      <br>
      Outliers within the Tonnes of Emissions per $ of GDP include Under-developed country Ethiopia who had the 3rd lowest value of only $238.84 per Tonne. This is directly reflective of Ethiopia's large renewable energy usage rate of 90% primarily 
      sourced from their hyrdoelectric power plant. <a href="Web_Vis_Home_P.HTML#[3]"> <i>[3] Ethiopia Looks to Tap Its Massive Renewable Energy Potential. </i> </a>
